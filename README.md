Possible Improvements
- Save album Api Urls in the Appsettings
- Make controller accept Pagination
- Add memory cache to decrease the number of calls to the 3rd party api (if the nature of the data allows it)
- Add a retry system to call the 3rd party Api (use library like Polly)
- Add authentication to the controllers (increase security)

Notes about the solution
- Add swagger for your convenience
- Use CQRS to segregate Command and Query Responsabilities
